# Professional Self Assessment

## Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped you showcase your strengths, shape your professional goals and values, and prepare to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.

In my desires to become a senior software engineer at the current company I am employed as a software engineer, having a well rounded Understanding of computer science is crucial. My coursework through the program and developing my ePortfolio has deepened my understanding of several crucial topics in computer science, including software engineering/design, algorithms/data structures, and databases. In my coursework, I have learned different strategies to communicate with other developers and stakeholders. By learning methodologies like Agile development, I have learned techniques to maximize development efficiency and provide users with a product that meets their needs. Through my coursework and ePortfolio, I have also used several data structures and algorithms to meet requirements efficiently. In my mobile application, I created a custom caching feature using a hash map to make the application more scalable and decrease the amount of load on the database. Learning about databases, including SQL and NOSQL databases, has increased my understanding of how applications can scale and how to securely store data. One of the most important topics I have covered in my time in the computer science program is security. When writing applications that store user data, it is important to build trust with your users by providing a secure database. By implementing encryption and decryption, secure coding practices and test-driven development, I am able to build applications that are secure and scalable for users.

## Summarize and introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole.
Using my mobile application from the CS-360 (Mobile Architecture and Development) course, I was able to improve the application by applying software engineering/design, algorithms/data structures and database enhancements. By rewriting the application in Kotlin, I was able to migrate the application to the standard programming language for Android, and build a solid foundation for the other enhancements. Using algorithms and data structures, I implemented a custom caching feature that made the application more scalable for users, and decreased the load of the Firebase database, decreasing costs. Using Google Firebase Realtime Database, I was able to provide users a secure way of storing their data, so that their data is available anywhere, no matter what device. With all 3 of these enhancements, I have made a complete mobile application that leverages industry standards to provide users with a secure, well designed experience.

# Narratives

## Software Engineering and Design

### Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

This artifact is the Android mobile application from the CS-360 course at SNHU. I created this application in March of 2024, and it was the final project for the course. It is an inventory management application that authenticates a user, gives them a grid view of their inventory items, and allows the user to add items to the grid view. The app supports SMS messaging and prompts the user to set permissions if they want to receive SMS messages. When an item is low in quantity, it will send the user a text message when it is below a certain amount.

### Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

The CS-360 final project covers a lot of topics of computer science, namely UI design, backend development, frontend development, and databases. I selected the item because the final project had a lot of room for improvement, and I had a lot of routes to go for improvement. I chose to rewrite the application Kotlin because it is now the standard programming language for Android development. In the CS-360 course, we were required to use Java and not Kotlin. First, I cleaned up the existing code that was written in Java, and then I rewrote the application in Kotlin. The XML that I created to outline the UI displays by ability to design an efficient UI for a user. The Kotlin classes show my ability to write efficient logic for the backend of my application to control data that is displayed to the user. The artifact was improved by cleaning up the existing code and rewriting the entire application in a new programming language, Kotlin.

### Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? How did you incorporate feedback as you made changes to the artifact? How was the artifact improved? Which course outcomes did you partially or fully meet with your enhancements? Which do you feel were not met?

There are several things I learned about the Kotlin programming language while modifying the artifact. First, Kotlin removes a lot of boilerplate code that Java forces you to write. This makes the code much more readable and easier to maintain. Something else I noticed when writing Kotlin is that it has type inference and has features such as smart casting that makes writing code easier and more fluent. A few challenges I faced were getting dependencies setup in the Gradle build file, and I ran into several bugs when trying to transfer the app to Kotlin. Using the debugger and troubleshooting, I was able to resolve these bugs and got the app working as it was when it was written in Java.

### The following course objectives I met with this artifact:

- Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science

### How did I meet this requirement?

By rewriting this application in the standard programming language for Android Development, this allows a more collaborative environment by adopting a more common practice. By continuing to use Java, I am limiting the number of developers that will be willing to contribute to the project. Another way I have achieved this is by creating documentation using KDOCS for the application. Here is the link for KDOCS in my repo. https://github.com/DawsonDF/DawsonDF.github.io/tree/main/Databases/app_inventory_management/kdoc/app/com.example.freeman_option1

- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

### How did I meet this requirement?

By providing clearly written and intuitive documentation, I have communicated the different components of the application and what their functionality is. Using KDOCS and code comments, I have provided professional quality written and visual communication to the other developers that will work on this project. I have also provided a code review video to orally and visually communicate the goals of the application.

- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

### How did I meet this requirement?

By using several different technologies (Kotlin, XML, Gradle, etc....) I have displayed my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools. I have showed my ability to adapt to new programming languages and provide solutions that are industry standard.

# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

This artifact is the Android mobile application from the CS-360 course at SNHU. I created this application in March of 2024, and it was the final project for the course. It is an inventory management application that authenticates a user, gives them a grid view of their inventory items, and allows the user to add items to the grid view. The app supports SMS messaging and prompts the user to set permissions if they want to receive SMS messages. When an item is low in quantity, it will send the user a text message when it is below a certain amount.

## Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

The artifact I selected is a great display of knowledge for the computer science program because it covers computer science topics such as databases, UI design, software design and data structures in algorithms. Specifically, I created a custom caching feature that utilizes a hash map to cache recently retrieved data that the user retrieved from the database. There are several benefits of having a cache in a mobile application. First, it makes the application more performant because instead of grabbing the data from the database, it has it stored in local memory, making it faster for the user. Also, it makes the application more scalable because instead of querying the database every time a user needs data, it can grab from the cache and create less load on the server. Before this enhancement, the app would retrieve data from the database, making it less scalable and less performant.

## Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? How did you incorporate feedback as you made changes to the artifact? How was the artifact improved? Which course outcomes did you partially or fully meet with your enhancements? Which do you feel were not met?

In the previous enhancement, I converted the application to Kotlin. Learning Kotlin while also solving the caching problem became a challenge. I learned the standards for implementing a hash map in Kotlin, and I also learned a lot about caching and now have a deep understanding of how they work. Some challenges that I faced were creating the logic for the custom cache map and transferring that pseudocode and logic into a programming language I am unfamiliar with (Kotlin).

### The following course objectives I met with this artifact:

- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms)

### How did I meet this requirement?

By using a hash map to implement a custom cache for my application, I demonstrated my ability to use data structures and algorithms to solve a problem. Caching is a standard technique in computer science to provide a more performant application.

- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)

### How did I meet this requirement?

By using a custom cache that I built, I was able to use innovation to create a more performant application for users. Caching is a standard tool in computer science and requires skills with hash maps to implement.

# Databases

## Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

This artifact is the Android mobile application from the CS-360 course at SNHU. I created this application in March of 2024, and it was the final project for the course. It is an inventory management application that authenticates a user, gives them a grid view of their inventory items, and allows the user to add items to the grid view. The app supports SMS messaging and prompts the user to set permissions if they want to receive SMS messages. When an item is low in quantity, it will send the user a text message when it is below a certain amount.

## Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

The artifact I selected is a great display of knowledge for the computer science program because it covers computer science topics such as databases, UI design, software design and data structures in algorithms. Specifically, I have made an enhancement to the database by using Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication. I selected this item because it had a SQLLITE local database, making a perfect route for me to improve the database. When a device is wiped, or even lost, all the data stored on the SQLLITE database will be lost. This means that all the data the user had for the application will be completely lost. The Firebase database that I have used will allow the user to login from any device on the application and access their data. This also improves the security of the application. Before, it stored their password in plaintext in the database. Using Firebase authentication, I can provide the user with a more secure application and keep their data secure. Firebase is certified under major privacy and security standards and is a standard for authenticating mobile applications.

How did you incorporate feedback as you made changes to the artifact? How was the artifact improved? Which course outcomes did you partially or fully meet with your enhancements? Which do you feel were not met?

Firebase was entirely new to me before this project. I had never used it and only found it when researching ideas for my capstone. I learned a lot about NoSQL databases and Firebase specifically. Firebase will be fantastic to put on my resume, as it is a popular tool developed by Google. I faced several challenges on this milestone, including getting the database connected, writing the logic for authorization and writing the logic to store the data in the database.

### The following course objectives I met with this artifact:

- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

### How did I meet this requirement?

I met this requirement by using a popular technology that is used by over 3000 companies, Firebase. I implemented authentication and a real-time database with Firebase. By using Firebase authentication and an industry standard database, I was able to store and process user's data securely. To login to the app, the user must login using the Firebase authentication API. With the Firebase console, I can look at analytics about my app's usage and the data.
